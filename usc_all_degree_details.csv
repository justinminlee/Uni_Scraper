This is usually a bachelor’s degree (generally three years) or a bachelor’s degree withhonours(generally four years).UniSC also offers a wide range of single ordoublebachelor degrees.Some UniSC degrees (also called ‘programs’) offer a graduate entry option. If you’ve already completed an undergraduate degree, and want to do another one in a different field, you can often fast-track completion of your next program.UniSC programs include a strong focus on the core skills you’ll need in the future workplace. No matter what you study, you’ll learn to communicate well, solve problems and think creatively. All programs include hands-on training, practical experience, and internships.","A double degree lets you combine knowledge and skills from two different fields. If you’re a little bit more ambitious, UniSC offers a range of career-focused double degrees that will broaden your horizons and make your career options twice as bright.You can study two related fields, or combine a professional qualification with an industry you are interested in (like business and science, or law and environmental management). You can also use your second degree to study something you love, like creative writing.A double degree usually involves the same workload and number of courses per semester as a single degree. You complete the core courses from each degree, but study fewer electives, which saves time and fees.With just one extra year of study, you’ll graduate with two qualifications and more flexibility in your chosen career.","An honours degree is a higher qualification than a bachelor’s degree. Honours is a great way to deepen your knowledge in a particular area and build advanced research, writing and critical thinking skills.There are different kinds of honours programs.End-on honours programsThese programs involve one extra year of study, in addition to your bachelor degree. You can apply for a one-year honours program after you have completed a bachelor degree in the same discipline.During your honours year, you work one-on-one with a UniSC academic, who is known as your supervisor. They help you design a research project and write a thesis on a topic you’re passionate about.Embedded honours programsSome four-year bachelor programs include an honours qualification. If you study one of these programs, you will automatically graduate with honours.Other programs, like UniSC’s Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Nutrition and Dietetics, don’t require an extra year of study, but let you choose an honours ‘pathway’ in your third or fourth year depending on your level of achievement.",Associate degrees (generally two years) give a broad introduction to a field of interest and can lead to further study.Associate Degree in BusinessAssociate Degree in Science,Diplomas (generally one year) give a broad introduction to a field of interest and can lead to further study.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is usually a bachelor’s degree (generally three years) or a bachelor’s degree withhonours(generally four years).UniSC also offers a wide range of single ordoublebachelor degrees.Some UniSC degrees (also called ‘programs’) offer a graduate entry option. If you’ve already completed an undergraduate degree, and want to do another one in a different field, you can often fast-track completion of your next program.UniSC programs include a strong focus on the core skills you’ll need in the future workplace. No matter what you study, you’ll learn to communicate well, solve problems and think creatively. All programs include hands-on training, practical experience, and internships.","A double degree lets you combine knowledge and skills from two different fields. If you’re a little bit more ambitious, UniSC offers a range of career-focused double degrees that will broaden your horizons and make your career options twice as bright.You can study two related fields, or combine a professional qualification with an industry you are interested in (like business and science, or law and environmental management). You can also use your second degree to study something you love, like creative writing.A double degree usually involves the same workload and number of courses per semester as a single degree. You complete the core courses from each degree, but study fewer electives, which saves time and fees.With just one extra year of study, you’ll graduate with two qualifications and more flexibility in your chosen career.","An honours degree is a higher qualification than a bachelor’s degree. Honours is a great way to deepen your knowledge in a particular area and build advanced research, writing and critical thinking skills.There are different kinds of honours programs.End-on honours programsThese programs involve one extra year of study, in addition to your bachelor degree. You can apply for a one-year honours program after you have completed a bachelor degree in the same discipline.During your honours year, you work one-on-one with a UniSC academic, who is known as your supervisor. They help you design a research project and write a thesis on a topic you’re passionate about.Embedded honours programsSome four-year bachelor programs include an honours qualification. If you study one of these programs, you will automatically graduate with honours.Other programs, like UniSC’s Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Nutrition and Dietetics, don’t require an extra year of study, but let you choose an honours ‘pathway’ in your third or fourth year depending on your level of achievement.",Associate degrees (generally two years) give a broad introduction to a field of interest and can lead to further study.Associate Degree in BusinessAssociate Degree in Science,Diplomas (generally one year) give a broad introduction to a field of interest and can lead to further study.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
